*Testing pushing to GitHub

- First, create a folder
- Then, do `git init`
- Then you need to commit your changes:
-- `git status` (see what has changed)
-- `git add <filename> (stage your changes to go up to GitHub
-- `git commit -v` (this opens Nano, and allows you to edit your commit message)
-- `git push origin <branchname>` (this pushes up to the GitHub repo that you linked
